\thispagestyle{empty}

I am grateful to Thales for providing me with the opportunity to work on such a challenging project. I am particularly thankful to my supervisors and colleagues Daniel La Mela, Chang Sung, and Mark Tadourian for their guidance over these past 6 months. I would also like to thank my academic supervisor, Dr. Dong Yuan, without whose support, patience, and care, this thesis would not be here today. 

%To my family: Mum, Dad, and Oshin -- this thesis would not have been possible without your support. To my friends, close or afar...

% Most importantly thank you to Udit Samant for the bants. The most signficant contribution to me.
